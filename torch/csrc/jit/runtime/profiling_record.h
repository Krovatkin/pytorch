  // A very brief high-level description of an algorithm for
  // constructing sets of dynamic/symbolic shapes.
  // Each set is represented by a ShapeSymbol which can be
  // static or dynamic
  // We implicitly keep track of elements of sets (Value*, i)
  // by assigning a ShapeSymbol to a dimension i in sizes_ of the TensorType of
  // a Value if sizes_[1] of %1 and sizes_[2] of %2 have the same
  // ShapeSymbol(-3, false) they belong to the same set. The algorithm has two
  // main stages. The first stage is to construct symbolic sets for one
  // profiling execution of a graph
  //  * if `sizes_[i]` was never assigned to a set before, it is assigned a
  //  static ShapeSymbol(dim_value, true)
  //    this gives us the initial sets.
  //  * if `sizes_[i]` was assigned before (this could happen if a profiled use
  //  is in a loop) there are 4 cases to handle (`mergeSymbolicShapes`)
  //    * if the ShapeSymbol X at `sizes_[i]` is static and a new symbol is
  //    equal to it (belong to the same set), we keep the original symbol
  //    * if the ShapeSymbol X at sizes_[i] is static and a new symbol is not
  //    equal, we will assign sizes_[i] to a new symbol (this is equivalent to
  //    creating a new subset)
  //    * if the ShapeSymbol X at sizes_[i] is dynamic but we didn't assign it
  //    yet, we will sizes_[i] to a new symbol.
  //         Note, ShapeSymbol can be used both as a Symbol but also as a value
  //         assigned to a Symbol
  //    * if the ShapeSymbol X at sizes_[i] is dynamic and assigned and a new
  //    symbol is equal to the assigned sizes_[i], we keep the original symbol
  //    * if the ShapeSymbol X at sizes_[i] is dynamic and assigned isn't equal
  //    to the assigned sizes_[i], we create a new subset that is represented by
  //    a new symbol whenever we see the same new symbol is being matched
  //    against the ShapeSymbol X we will put it in the same subset.
  // The second stage is to merge symbolic sets from all profiling executions of
  // the graph Since merge/refinement operation is commutative, the order in
  // which we merge symbolic sets from different runs doesn't matter we use the
  // sets from the first run as our initial sets and we essentially reuse the
  // same merge algorithm `mergeSymbolicShapes` the stage 2 adds one extra case
  // we need to deal with is when the runs we processed so far don't have
  // profiling information for some uses that the current run we are merging the
  // information from has. This could happen if the first run executed the then
  // arm of an if and the second run executed the else arm. Since some
  // ShapeSymbols in the current run might already belong to a set we do a
  // reverse search to find which set the ShapeSymbol belongs. Ideally, we would
  // like to put it in the biggest set to be optimal but currently for
  // simplicity we put in a set whose ShapeSymbol was mapped to it the latest.
